# Eight-sorting-algorithms
I write 8 common sorting algorithm from the begining.
The program needs to be compiled with c++11. There are "-bubble", "-altbubble", "-insertion", "-heap", "-merge", "-quick", "-bucket", "-radix" in total. Each input mode corresponds to the corresponding sorting algorithm.

---The first number entered is the total number of numbers to be sorted.

P.S.

-By experiments, I find that the time required to output the program to the file is much longer than the time required for sorting, so if you need to compare the running time of each algorithm, please comment out the output part (cout) in the main function.

-The first three algorithms are not recommended to run when n>50000.

-The recommended range of the last five algorithms is n<100000000.

-Attach a test script (above python3.2) (put it together with the compiled file (file name test), enter n. Automatically generate testcase, output the running time of each sort, and make a difference)
